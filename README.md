# blob_simulation_and_detection
The project consists of two python scripts: sim_cls.py and cent.py.
The sim_cls.py simulates and writes an png image of 512 by 512 pixels with blobs. It takes number of blobs, probability of noise in gaussian distribution and radius of blobs as argument. 

The cent.py detects those blobs and their center.
